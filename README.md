# 3DPlatform-Game
Third person platform game with 3D environment created with Unity & Blender. 2 Levels.

## Description
A 3D third person jumping platform game where you collect gems and try not to fall off the edge.

## Note
This was for a game development course I took. After 2 levels and submission, it was discarded.  
I apologize for the lack of file organization for that very reason.

## Help
Main scripts found in Assets/Scripts

### Dependencies
- TextMeshPro for fonts and UI
- Jasper (3D Character) from Adobe. Meta files located in .../Character1/
